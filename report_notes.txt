Design Decisions
----------------
- When evaluating future moves, there are two ways to preserve past moves:
  1. Maintain a log of all moves made and undo a move after evaluating it.
     Pros:
     - Able to keep track of various game state attributes (e.g., score, surface area).
     Cons:
     - Need to undo and pop off various game state logs after each evaluation.
  2. Save a copy of the board, make a move, and then evaluate the board after making the move.
     Pros:
     - No need to undo each time a child completes an evaluation.
     Cons:
     - Requires recalculating game state stats for each new move.
     - (Potentially) Requires saving many game states.

- Board Evaluation
  1. Bit Boards: Representing the board as two 128-bit integers.
     Pros:
     - Very efficient in terms of space and being able to perform bit operations.
     Cons:
     - Complicated to implement.
  2. 2D Integer Array
     Pros:
     - Simpler to implement and more intuitive to work with.
     Cons:
     - Python arrays are very inefficient.

Known Bugs
----------
   - You are able to click outside the board on the very edges of the map.
